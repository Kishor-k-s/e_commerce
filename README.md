# 🛒 E-Commerce Website (Amazon-like Clone)

A full-fledged **E-Commerce web application** built using **Django**, designed to simulate an online shopping experience similar to Amazon.  
Users can browse products, add them to a cart, edit quantities, delete items, and proceed to checkout — all while tracking their orders.  
In addition, a **Blog Section** is integrated to help users stay informed about new arrivals, shopping tips, and product-related insights.  
Instead of traditional authentication, this project uses **LocalStorage** to manage user data on the client side.
